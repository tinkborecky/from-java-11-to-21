### Virtual Threads:

Enables server applications written in the simple thread-per-request style to scale with near-optimal hardware
utilization.
Enables existing code that uses the java.lang.Thread API to adopt virtual threads with minimal change.
Enables easy troubleshooting, debugging, and profiling of virtual threads with existing JDK tools.
Accelerates application development productivity such as apps targeted for cloud environments by introducing Virtual
threads, which are lightweight threads that dramatically reduce the effort of writing, maintaining, and observing
high-throughput concurrent applications.
